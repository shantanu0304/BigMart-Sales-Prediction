# BigMart-Sales-Prediction

### I am going to predict ITEM OUTLET SALES using the Big Mart dataset (available on kaggle link is below). I would also be providing a step-by-step approach of dealing with untidy dataset and preparing it for the ultimate aim of model building. 

## Tools used -
* Python – 3.7.2
* Anaconda Navigator – 1.9.6 
* Jupyter Notebook – 5.7.4
## Libraries Used:
* Analyzing: Numpy, Pandas, Sci-kit Learn
* Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/devashish0507/big-mart-sales-prediction

## Regressors Used – 
* Multiple Linear Regression 
* Support Vector Regression
* Random Forest Regression
* Decision tree

### Best regression model in this case comes out to be SVM with 94.8% accuracy
